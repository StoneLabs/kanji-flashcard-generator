# What kanjis are this?

> Kyōiku kanji (教育漢字, literally "education kanji"), also known as Gakunenbetsu kanji haitōhyō (学年別漢字配当表, literally "list of kanji by school year") is a list of 1,026 kanji and associated readings developed and maintained by the Japanese Ministry of Education that prescribes which kanji, and which readings of kanji, Japanese students should learn from first grade to the sixth grade (elementary school).

See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ky%C5%8Diku_kanji) for more details.

# How to print

Make sure to print multiples pages onto one. If you dont, you'll end up with A4 flash cards.
Most print dialogues will have an option for this. (Microsoft Edge for example if you cant find one)

# Customize

Customization is limited at the moment. Because i honestly dont care :)

You can change the font or the background image files before generating the cards though.
